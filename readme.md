# This is Lusen's work on the laravel-tricks 

## Changes I have made

```
void main() 
{}
```


### Downgrade php7 to php5.6

### Download guzzle

This is because there is error with GuzzleClient 

### Download ace.js to local directory (js/min-src-noconflict) and modifies corresponding references.

### Change the MYSQL mode to allow ZERO value


### Renamed serveral .js files and .png .jpg files to remove the errors.


## TIPS

Using Chrome's "inspect" to view the errors.

Search for the errors on the Internet
